👋 Hi, I’m @TequilaBoomBoom.                                                                                                                                                       
👀 I’m interested in learning Solidity, Javascript, Node.js and what about Web2 and Web3.                                                                                         
🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript (in free time after work).                                                                                                                     
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with people and companies working in everything related to the Web2 and Web3 and also with blockchain and crypto.
