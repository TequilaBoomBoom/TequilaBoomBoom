👋 Hi, I’m @TequilaBoomBoom
👀 I’m interested in learning Solidity, Javascript, Node.js and what about Web2 and Web3.
🌱 I’m currently learning Solidity (in free time after work).
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with people and companies working in blockchain and crypto, but also everything related to the Web.
📫 How to reach me : currently contact me here.
